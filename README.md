This document serves as a technical white paper for the Alternative Perspective Theory, a novel framework developed to model reality through multi-valued logic and probabilistic aggregation of diverse viewpoints. It is intended for public dissemination and can be hosted on GitHub for open access, collaboration, and further refinement. The theory bridges philosophical perspectivism with computational models, offering applications in artificial intelligence, social sciences, and decision theory.
